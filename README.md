# Final Semester Grade Required

This is just a fun and really simple streamlit project to teach how to easily get a Python Script running with a user-interface using the streamlit library. 

Due to COVID-19, my final semesters were cancelled and my grades were alloted on the basis of the average of previous semesters. However, then UGC decided to intervene and after a lot of legal battles, the Supreme Court decided to force the universities to mandatorily conduct the final semester examinations. 

I wrote a small python script to find the GPA we needed to keep in the final semester to be able to keep our target CGPA. With examinations being conducted after 6 months, none of us were in touch with our books and with just seven days of time given to recap our syllabus, this tool came in really handy for my friends who just wanted to find the minimum they need to score to keep their overall CGPA floating xD. 

Anyway, I thought it will be a fun demo to actually demonstrate the use of Streamlit. 

So to get started:
1) Fork this repository.
2) Make simply make changes to the app.py to run your own script. 
3) Go over to HerokuApp [here](https://heroku.com), sign up and connect your GitHub account.
4) Click on new app and give a name.
5) Click on GitHub icon. 
6) Search for the repository.
7) Click on Connect.
8) Enable Automatic Deploys (You can directly make changes on GitHub and Heroku will automatically update your site).
9) Click on Deploy Branch.

That is it.
